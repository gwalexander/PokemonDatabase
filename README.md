# Pokemon Database

This program was made to give me a chance to use a larger  and more complex API and the be able to use this data for quereys within a database.

## Description

The program uses a local database and data retrived from the "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon" API. It get the users login and creates an acount for them in the database then askes them for their 6 favoritre pokemon that is stores in a relational database. you cam also retrive your favorite pokemon form the database.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* It requires the "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon" API to be still working (it is currently (November 2024))
* It also requires a local database called "pokemon_db" or you can change the refrence.
